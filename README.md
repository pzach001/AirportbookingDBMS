This program was created for the CS166(Database Management Systems Class) at UCR during the Fall 2017 quarter  by Anthony Mai and Phillip Zachariah\
\
Introduction:\
	\
	this project was created using source code provided by the professor. His code was written in java and is basically a skeleton code so that we could use POSTGRESQL.\
	Our code was implementing the user functions and the POSTGRESQL Queries that the user functions run.\
\
Description of Code:\
\
	This projects simulates an airport system connected to a database. The database has 4 tables, Airlines, Flight/Route, Passenger, and Rating. The code implemented has to do with 9 user functions which take in user input and then either displays or alters  through queries. The nine queries are :

AddPassenger, BookFlight, TakeCustomerReview, InsertRoute, \cf4 ListAvailableFlightsBetweenOriginAndDestination, \cf2 ListMostPopularDestinations,ListHighestRatedRoutes, ListFlightFromOriginToDestinationInOrderOfDuration, FindNumberOfAvailableSeatsForFlight.

How to run:\
 \
	1. Setup up your database.\
	\
	 	This can be found on the READMe file in the scripts folder.\
\
	2. running the code.\
	\
		Information on how to run the code is provided  on the README file in the  java/lib folder.\
