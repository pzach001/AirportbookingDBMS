# AirportbookingDBMS
This program was created for the CS166(Database Management Systems Class) at UCR during the Fall 2017 quarter  by Anthony Mai and Phillip Zachariah

Introduction:
	
	this project was created using source code provided by the professor. His code was written in java and is basically a skeleton code so that we could use POSTGRESQL. Our code was implementing the user functions and the POSTGRESQL Queries that the user functions run.
  
Description of Code:

	This projects simulates an airport system connected to a database. The database has 4 tables, Airlines, Flight/Route, Passenger, and Rating. The code implemented has to do with 9 user functions which take in user input and then either displays or alters  through queries. 
	
How to run:
 
	1. Setup up your database.
	 	  This can be found on the READMe file in the scripts folder.

	2. running the code.
	    Information on how to run the code is provided  on the README file in the  java/lib folder.
